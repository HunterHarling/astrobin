            <p>{% blocktrans %}Yes. AstroBin is completely free!{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <h4>{% blocktrans %}Are there any limits on how large and how many images I can upload?{% endblocktrans %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}<strong>NO!</strong> On AstroBin you can upload as many images as you want, and as large as you want. In fact, full size images encouraged!{% endblocktrans %}

            <h4>{% blocktrans %}Where did you get the idea for this site?{% endblocktrans %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}I'm an astrophotographer myself, and an active member of several amateur astronomy forums. For some time I have seen how lots and lots of valuable images were scattered all over the Internet: on general purpose image hosting websites, on forum upload boards, on personal website, and on various places of disposable content.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}I realized that the astrophotography community was lacking a central hub. It needed a way to store all the data it was producing in a reliable and uniform fashion. It needed the visibility that such a great community deserves.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>

            <h4>{% blocktrans %}What are the plans for the future?{% endblocktrans %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}<em>AstroBin</em> is just starting out, and this time we can really say that the sky is the limit! I've got tons of ideas in the pipeline. As the user base grows, so does the data. Suddenly, things like automated sueernovae search become possible: you could simply upload an image of a galaxy, and AstroBin could compare it to pictures of the same galaxy taken previously.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}AstroBin could also recommend subjects for you to image! Knowing your equipment, your location, and comparing what you have imaged to what users similar to you have, AstroBin could suggest your next challange!{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Another interesting possibility are <em>Smart Albums</em>. Since all your images are supposed to be accompanied by lots of data about their acquisition, it will be easy for AstroBin to create dynamic image collections. So you can have your images quickly sorted by type of subject (galaxy, nebula, etc) or by telescope, or by some other piece of equipment, or by year.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Then there are stats, or course. As the amount of data increases, there is literally no limit at the amount of interesting stats that can be concieved.{% endblocktrans %}

        <li>
            <h4>{% blocktrans %}Why won't my image get plate-solved?{% endblocktrans %}</h4>
            <p>{% blocktrans %}Most images should get plate-solved if you've specified the correct pixel scale. When you're asked for the focal length of the telescope and the pixel size of the camera, remember that you have to consider binning and, importantly, image scaling. That means that if you resized the image before submitting to AstroBin, you have to take that into account when you write your pixel size. If you resized your image by 50%, then you have to double the size of the pixel.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Nonsense. AstroBin has <strong>not</strong> been made to showcase beautiful image, but to give everybody an opportunity to contribute to a vast and evergrowing effort of centralization and indexing of important data. That 30 minute picture of M31 you took last night between the clouds <em>belongs</em> here! Don't be shy and post it!{% endblocktrans %}

            <h4>{% blocktrans %}What's the deal with the Staging Area and the Public Area?{% endblocktrans %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}On AstroBin you have two places for our images. The Staging Area is where you can upload images that you want to quickly share on forums, mailing lists or social networks. The days of scaling down and compressing your image so you can upload it to a forum for feedback and critique are over! Just upload to AstroBin's Staging Area, and send the link to anyone you want. The image will be visible only to the intended recipients, and won't appear on your profile or AstroBin's home page.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}The Public Area, instead, is for your finished products. After you have received feedback on your favorite forum, you can promote an image from the Staging Area to the Public Area, and it will appear on your profile. Remember that you can also move images back and forth from one Area to the other as many times as you want!{% endblocktrans %}

            <h4>{% blocktrans %}Where did you get the idea for this site?{% endblocktrans %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}I'm an astrophotographer myself, and an active member of several amateur astronomy forums. For some time I have seen how lots and lots of valuable images were scattered all over the Internet: on general purpose image hosting websites, on forum upload boards, on personal website, and on various places of disposable content.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}I realized that the astrophotography community was lacking a central hub. It needed a way to store all the data it was producing in a reliable and uniform fashion. It needed the visibility that such a great community deserves.{% endblocktrans %}

            <h4>{% blocktrans %}What are the plans for the future?{% endblocktrans %}</h4>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}<em>AstroBin</em> is just starting out, and this time we can really say that the sky is the limit! I've got tons of ideas in the pipeline. As the user base grows, so does the data. Suddenly, things like automated supernovae search become possible: you could simply upload an image of a galaxy, and AstroBin could compare it to pictures of the same galaxy taken previously.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}AstroBin could also recommend subjects for you to image! Knowing your equipment, your location, and comparing what you have imaged to what users similar to you have, AstroBin could suggest your next challenge!{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Another interesting possibility are <em>Smart Albums</em>. Since all your images are supposed to be accompanied by lots of data about their acquisition, it will be easy for AstroBin to create dynamic image collections. So you can have your images quickly sorted by type of subject (galaxy, nebula, etc) or by telescope, or by some other piece of equipment, or by year.{% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <p>
            {% blocktrans %}Then there are stats, or course. As the amount of data increases, there is literally no limit at the amount of interesting stats that can be concieved.{% endblocktrans %}

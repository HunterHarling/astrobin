"I'm an astrophotographer myself, and an active member of several amateur "

"various places of disposable content."
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:24

"I realized that the astrophotography community was lacking a central hub. It "

msgid ""
"<em>AstroBin</em> is just starting out, and this time we can really say that "
"the sky is the limit! I've got tons of ideas in the pipeline. As the user "

"search become possible: you could simply upload an image of a galaxy, and "
"AstroBin could compare it to pictures of the same galaxy taken previously."
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:33

"AstroBin could also recommend subjects for you to image! Knowing your "

msgid ""
"Another interesting possibility are <em>Smart Albums</em>. Since all your "
"images are supposed to be accompanied by lots of data about their "

"(galaxy, nebula, etc) or by telescope, or by some other piece of equipment, "
"or by year."

    <li>Use the Site's API for any application that replicates or attempts to
        replace the essential user experience of the Site.</li>
    <li>Attempt to hide your application's identity when making API calls.</li>
    <li>Display more than 30 AstroBin images per page in your application, or
        otherwise consume an excessive amount of bandwidth.</li>

        below.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Commercial use of the API</h4>
<p>
If the primary purpose of your application is to derive revenue, it is
considered a commercial application. The Service Provider reserves the
right to make this evaluation at the time that you request an API key.

You may use the Site's API in a commercial application only if:
<ul>

        the display of astronomical images from third party services
        (one of which would be the Site).</li>

        for the usage of the Site's API.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Place the following notice prominently on your application:
        "This product uses the AstroBin API but is not endorsed or
        certified by AstroBin."</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Use the Site's logo without specific written permission from the
        Service Provider.</li>

        prominent than your own application's logo.</li>

</ul>

<h3>AFFILIATION PLATFORM</h3>

The Site offers an Affiliation Platform tailored to producers and retailers
of astronomical equipment, including, but not limited to, telescopes, DSLR
cameras, CCD cameras, planetary and guiding cameras, mounts, filters, software,
and all kinds of accessories to the aforementioned items.
</p>

<p>
Hereafter, we refer to a company or an individual who joined the Affiliation
Platform as "Affiliated partner."
</p>

<h4>Affliated platform conduct</h4>
<p>
In addition to the "User conduct" above, to which Affiliated Partners must abide
as they are considered users to all effects, an Affiliated Partner must not:
</p>

<ul>
<li>claim products that they do not produce or retail.</li>
<li>price their product differently than what they will really sell it for, for the purpose of luring AstroBin users to their website.</li>
<li>use the platform in any way that differs from what the Service Provider intended, by the sole judgment of the Service Provider.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Terms of payment</h4>
<p>
Affiliated Partners must pay the agreed sum by the due date indicated on the bill,
which is set as 14 days after the expiration of a billable period (one month.)
Failure to do so will incur in:
</p>

<ul>
<li>the suspension of their AstroBin account starting 7 days after the missed
due date, and effective until the payment terms are resolved.</li>
<li>a penalty fee of 8% of the due sum.</li>
</ul>

attorneys' fees and cost) from any claim or demand made by any third
party due to or arising out of your access to the Site, use of the
Services, violation of the Terms by you, or the infringement by you,

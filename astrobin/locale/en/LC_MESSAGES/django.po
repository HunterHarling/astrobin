msgid "Where did you get the idea for this site?"
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:21
msgid ""
"I'm an astrophotographer myself, and an active member of several amateur "
"astronomy forums. For some time I have seen how lots and lots of valuable "
"images were scattered all over the Internet: on general purpose image "
"hosting websites, on forum upload boards, on personal website, and on "
"various places of disposable content."
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:24
msgid ""
"I realized that the astrophotography community was lacking a central hub. It "
"needed a way to store all the data it was producing in a reliable and "
"uniform fashion. It needed the visibility that such a great community "
"deserves."
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:28
msgid "What are the plans for the future?"
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:30
msgid ""
"<em>AstroBin</em> is just starting out, and this time we can really say that "
"the sky is the limit! I've got tons of ideas in the pipeline. As the user "
"base grows, so does the data. Suddenly, things like automated supernovae "
"search become possible: you could simply upload an image of a galaxy, and "
"AstroBin could compare it to pictures of the same galaxy taken previously."
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:33
msgid ""
"AstroBin could also recommend subjects for you to image! Knowing your "
"equipment, your location, and comparing what you have imaged to what users "
"similar to you have, AstroBin could suggest your next challenge!"
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:36
msgid ""
"Another interesting possibility are <em>Smart Albums</em>. Since all your "
"images are supposed to be accompanied by lots of data about their "
"acquisition, it will be easy for AstroBin to create dynamic image "
"collections. So you can have your images quickly sorted by type of subject "
"(galaxy, nebula, etc) or by telescope, or by some other piece of equipment, "
"or by year."
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:39
msgid ""
"Then there are stats, or course. As the amount of data increases, there is "
"literally no limit at the amount of interesting stats that can be concieved."
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:43
msgid "Why won't my image get plate-solved?"
msgstr ""

#: templates/faq.html:44
#, python-format
msgid ""
"Most images should get plate-solved if you've specified the correct pixel "
"scale. When you're asked for the focal length of the telescope and the pixel "
"size of the camera, remember that you have to consider binning and, "
"importantly, image scaling. That means that if you resized the image before "
"submitting to AstroBin, you have to take that into account when you write "
"your pixel size. If you resized your image by 50%%, then you have to double "

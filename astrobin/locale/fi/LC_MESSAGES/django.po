"        <h4>Hey!</h4>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"        Are you an astrophotographer? Have you ever wanted to share the\n"
"        outcome of your hard work with others? I guess you already do\n"
"        that, but as an astrophotographer myself, and a subscriber to\n"
"        numerous Astrophotography forums, I have found that the\n"
"        Internet is lacking a centralized place where astrophotographers\n"
"        can share their work.\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <h4>Well, this is finally over!</h4>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"        <em>AstroBin</em> comes to fill the gap. It's a website built by an\n"
"        astrophotographer, and it provides means to people who want to\n"
"        share their astrophotographs.\n"
"        </p>\n"
"        <p><img src=\"/static/images/content/help_screenshot.png\"\n"
"                alt=\"AstroBin screenshot\"/></p>\n"
"        <h4>So how is this different from any other photo sharing sites?</"
"h4>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"        <em>AstroBin</em> provides a number of features that are tailored\n"
"        directly to astrophotography. Here's a quick run down of the main\n"
"        ones:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <h4>Dedication to data</h4>\n"
"                <p>On a general purpose photo sharing site, you would "
"upload\n"
"                   your image and be done with it. <em>AstroBin</em>, "
"instead,\n"
"                   has a user interface specifically designed to enable you\n"
"                   to input all the technical data of your image. And if "
"you\n"
"                   neglect to supply technical data to your image, "
"<em>AstroBin</em>\n"
"                   will periodically remind you to do so.\n"
"                </p>\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <h4>Data is strongly interconnected</h4>\n"
"                <p>Have you ever wanted to see how your next image is going\n"
"                   to look like? On <em>AstroBin</em>, you can search for\n"
"                   all images of a certain target that were taken with a\n"
"                   certain telescope and a certain CCD or camera. Or a "
"certain\n"
"                   filter. How about all the images between 6 and 8 hours "
"of\n"
"                   integration? Or with a certain Moon phase? You can do "
"that!\n"
"                </p>\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <h4>All the data at a glance</h4>\n"
"                <p>Each image on <em>AstroBin</em> is annotated of all the\n"
"                   technical details about its acquisition. Telescopes "
"involved,\n"
"                   cameras, mounts, filters, everything is visible at a "
"glance\n"
"                   in the Technical Card. Even the Moon age at the time of "
"the\n"
"                   acquisition is displayed.\n"
"                </p>\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <h4>More than just an image</h4>\n"
"                <p><em>AstroBin</em> will do more than just host a copy of "
"your\n"
"                   image: when you upload a photograph, a histogram and a "
"black\n"
"                   &amp; white inverted version of the image will be "
"generated\n"
"                   on the fly, so it's easier to spot faint nebulosity "
"regions\n"
"                   or spiral arms. On request, images can also be plate "
"solved,\n"
"                   and an annotated version will appear on the site.\n"
"                </p>\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <h4>AstroBin helps you out</h4>\n"
"                <p>Ever looked for a hint on what subject you should tackle "
"next?\n"
"                   <em>AstroBin</em> is able to make suggestions that suit "
"your\n"
"                   geographical location and your equipment!\n"
"                </p>\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <h4>Will you discover the next supernova?</h4>\n"
"                <p>Have you ever wondered if in your years long journey "
"into\n"
"                   astrophotography, having imaged tens or even hundreds of\n"
"                   galaxies, you might have discovered a supernova? "
"<em>AstroBin</em>\n"
"                   will compare your images of galaxies to older ones. They "
"will\n"
"                   be aligned, stacked, and examined for anomalies.\n"
"                </p>\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <h4>AstroBin is social!</h4>\n"
"                <p>On <em>AstroBin</em> you can message other "
"astrophotographer,\n"
"                   follow them and be notified when they post new images, "
"or\n"
"                   perform requests for more data. You can also vote on "
"images.\n"
"                </p>\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <h4>AstroBin supports multiple image revisions</h4>\n"
"                <p>Don't tell me you have never gone back to revise the "
"processing\n"
"                   of an image <em>after</em> you have published. "
"<em>AstroBin</em>\n"
"                   embraces this concept and lets you publish several "
"revisions of\n"
"                   the same image easily and intuitively!\n"
"                </p>\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"        <p>\n"
"            As you have undoubtly realized by now, <em>AstroBin</em> is way "
"more\n"
"            than an image hosting service. It's what the Astrophotography\n"
"            community has needed for a long time. For years, I have seen "
"amazing\n"
"            images scattered all over the Internet: general purpose image "
"hosting\n"
"            sites, forums, personal websites and even temporary places. Some "
"of\n"
"            those images contain data that is too precious to go wasted in a "
"sea\n"
"            of chaos.\n"
"            <em>AstroBin</em> comes to the rescue to provide a home and a "
"central\n"
"            hub for astrophotographers all over the world.\n"

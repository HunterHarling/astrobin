{% blocktrans %}PLEASE NOTE: if you have an auto-renewing membership that you activated before January 1st 2018, it is recommended that you cancel it, to avoid double-billing.{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}In 2018, AstroBin moved from auto-renewing to non-auto-renewing memberships, so if you purchase a new yearly membership, do not forget to cancel your old auto-renewing one. If you don't know how to do that, please get in touch to get help.{% endblocktrans %}

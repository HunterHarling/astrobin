The following dirty hacks are currently implemented by hard-coding on the
production server:

1) The csrf_exempt decorator is added to the ipn view of django-paypal
   To do it the proper way, install django-paypal from a better fork.

2) The close() function in django/db/backends/__init__.py has been changed
   according to https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15802
   To do it the proper way, upgrade to django 1.4.


Some Postgres INDECES:

create INDEX on astrobin_image using btree (uploaded, id);
create INDEX on actstream_action using btree (timestamp);
create index on toggleproperties_toggleproperty using btree(property_type, content_type_id, object_id);
create index on toggleproperties_toggleproperty using btree(property_type, content_type_id, created_on);
CREATE INDEX object_id_integer_cast ON toggleproperties_toggleproperty (CAST(toggleproperties_toggleproperty.object_id AS INT))

CREATE VIEW recently_liked_viewd AS
SELECT toggleproperties_toggleproperty.object_id::int AS object_id, MAX(toggleproperties_toggleproperty.created_on) AS like_created_on
FROM toggleproperties_toggleproperty
WHERE toggleproperties_toggleproperty.property_type = 'like'
GROUP BY toggleproperties_toggleproperty.object_id
LIMIT 640;

CREATE VIEW recently_bookmarked_view AS
SELECT toggleproperties_toggleproperty.object_id::int AS object_id, MAX(toggleproperties_toggleproperty.created_on) AS bookmark_created_on
FROM toggleproperties_toggleproperty
WHERE toggleproperties_toggleproperty.property_type = 'bookmark'
GROUP BY toggleproperties_toggleproperty.object_id
LIMIT 640;

GRANT ALL ON recently_liked_view to astrobin;
GRANT ALL ON recently_bookmarked_view to astrobin;

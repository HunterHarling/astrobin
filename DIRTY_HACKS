The following dirty hacks are currently implemented by hard-coding on the
production server:

1) The csrf_exempt decorator is added to the ipn view of django-paypal
   To do it the proper way, install django-paypal from a better fork.

2) The close() function in django/db/backends/__init__.py has been changed
   according to https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15802
   To do it the proper way, upgrade to django 1.4.
